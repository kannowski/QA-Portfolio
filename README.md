# My QA Portfolio

Welcome! I'm a Quality Assurance Analyst II with 4 years of remote experience (including QA Lead) in manual software testing, creating test cases, writing documentation, and bug logging.

This is where I'll share examples of my work using public websites, and apps - never anything confidential

More coming soon!
